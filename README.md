# Overall Project Milestones


-  struct-copying assignments, struct parameters, or struct returns.

-  goto statements.

-  casting between integers and pointers.

    * May be able to change the axioms and create abstraction layer.

        + There are at least three layers

    * Characterizes direct memory access "int* ptr = 10;" 
    
        + Sound does not automatically mean safe in this case

-  structured switch statements (Duff's device).

    * Could be done in theory I think

    * Or the optimization could be ignored and turned into a simple for loop
