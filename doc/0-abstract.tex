Coq is a programming language and theorem prover. It has many programming tools including the Verified Software Toolchain (VST).
The VST project is designed to bring software verification techniques to C, a popular memory managing language. Doing software verification with programming languages, that have memory management as part of their syntax,
is done using separation logic. This is due to the frame axiom that separation logic provides, allowing valid propositions invariant to the entire memory heap. There are many features to add to VST to extend its usefulness in software verification. One such feature that would be helpful is the ability to copy C structs, which is what I added to VST. I did this indirectly to VST, and am still working on a translation to a proven and C17 version.
